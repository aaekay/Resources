# locating the variant

recombinant fraction: The proportion of gametes that are recombinant for two loci is the recombination fraction between the two loci.. Eg: In Figure 17.3 individual II1 is heterozygous at two loci (A and B ). He has the genotype A 1 A 2 B 1 B 2 . His alleles A 1 and B 1 came from his mother, and A 2 and B 2 from his father. Any of his sperm that carries one of these parental combinations (A 1 B 1 or A 2 B 2 ) is nonrecombinant for those two loci, whereas any that carries A 1 B 2 or A 2 B 1 is recombinant. We see that of his seven children, two were produced by recombinant sperm and five by nonrecombinant sperm. The recombination fraction is 0.28. Recombination fractions never exceed 0.5. 

syntenic: When two loci are syntenic —that is, they lie on the same chromosome—they will always travel together unless separated by recombination

genetic distance vs physical distance: Thus the recombination fraction between two loci is a measure of their distance apart on the chromosome. This is the genetic distance . It is measured in centiMorgans (cM, the uppercase M honors the pioneering geneticist TH Morgan), as distinct from the physical distance , measured in kilobases or megabases of DNA. Pairs of loci that recombine 1% of the time are said to be 1 cM apart.

autozygosity mapping: Thus identifying segments in a patient’s genome that are homozygous and identical by descent (autozygous ) identifies candidate locations for the disease gene. This is the basis of autozygosity mapping .
The potential of autozygosity for disease mapping was first demonstrated by Houwen and colleagues in 1994 (PMID 7894490; see Further Reading).

Unrelated individuals might be homozygous for different alleles, but the region where they are homozygous should be the same. The resolution is highest when unrelated individuals are studied, though this carries the risk that different genes might be mutated in the different families, even though they all have the same clinical condition. 


# population and breeding
assortive mating: All population substructure leads to assortative mating , violating the random mating requirement of the Hardy–Weinberg relationship
Sewall Wright’s FST statistic gives a measure of how different two (sub)populations are by considering how much heterozygosity would be gained if the two were a single random-mating population. FST varies between 0 (the two populations are identical) and 1 (complete genetic separation; different alleles are fixed at each locus in the two). FST is sometimes called a fixation index

coefficient of inbreeding and coefficient of relationship are relevant for thinking about the risk of recessive disease
The coefficient of relationship of two individuals is the proportion of alleles they share that are identical by descent
The coefficient of inbreeding of an individual is the probability that, at a given locus, they receive two alleles that are identical by descent.

# sequencing
In Section 6.5 we described the main next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, and illustrated how their raw output consisted of millions of short reads that needed to be aligned against the human reference sequence (see Figure 6.20 ). This process and all subsequent stages in the analysis are extremely computationally intensive and require substantial bioinformatic expertise to perform them correctly. Figure 17.11 gives an overview of the steps necessary; interested readers should consult the paper by DePristo and colleagues (PMID 21478889; see Further Reading) for technical detail.

To replicate within cells, the DNA molecules need a suitable origin of replication, a DNA sequence that will initiate DNA replication in that cell type (molecules like this are known as replicons). A convenient solution is to take advantage of replication origins in DNA molecules that naturally replicate within the host cells.
