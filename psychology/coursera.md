# defence mechanisms
1. displacement: father hating child bullies kids
2. sublimation: forbidden sex desires seeking people devote extra time to work
3. projection: you disliking somebody and then you think that other person hates you
4. rationalisation: reasoning away anxiety producing thoughts, father beating child for child owns good
5. regression: regressing to earlier stage of development due to stress, can be seen in child
6. reaction formation: replacing threatening wishes to the opposite 

hysteria: when you cant contain the id, you devleop blindmess, paralysis, trembling, panic attacks, gap memory etc

catharsis: an explosive release of locked away memories


science vs non science : falsifiability by popper, not the sole criteria

## taking freud seriously
instance of some toilet training have proven correct
influence on clinical psyhchology
thinking about mind
freud's idea of dream, a lot of might be bogus but some might be valuable

## inductive or deductive reasoning
inductive: drawing conclusions from a set of observations, eg science of meteorology
deductive: proof more associated, eg all living cells contain DNA

## level of analysis

# skinner
Presented the theory of behaviourism, articulated what was already there

main ideas of behaviourism
1. emphasis of learning - watson arguement of providing them the dozen healthy infants
2. anti - metalism == stick to things we can observe like observations, stimulus, responses rather than beliving on emotions, desires
3. no differences across species

# learning principles

## Habituation
## conditioning
### classical 
extinction
spontaneous recovery = response after some period of extinction
renewal effect =  After extinction, if the CS is tested in a new context, such as a different room or location, the CR can also return. In the chalkboard example, the action of entering a new building—where you don’t expect to smell chalkboards—suddenly renews the sensations associated with detention

### instrumental
learning what works and what doesnt
it is active
based on your own actions
the law of effect: the tendancy to perform an action reinforced if rewarded
reinforecements
    positive
    negative
shaping = activities which are approximated to action which is needed to reinforced

terms
1. stimulus control behaviour: , lever-pressing can be reinforced only when a light in the Skinner box is turned on; when the light is off, no food is released from lever-pressing
2. discriminative stimulus: The stimulus controlling the operant response is called a discriminative stimulus
3. quantitative law of effect: The law acknowledges the fact that the effects of reinforcing one behavior depend crucially on how much reinforcement is earned for the behavior’s alternatives. For example, if a pigeon learns that pecking one light will reward two food pellets, whereas the other light only rewards one, the pigeon will only peck the first light. However, what happens if the first light is more strenuous to reach than the second one? Will the cost of energy outweigh the bonus of food? Or will the extra food be worth the work?
4. reinforcer devaluation effect: A rat is first trained to perform two instrumental actions (e.g., pressing a lever on the left, and on the right), each paired with a different reinforcer (e.g., a sweet sucrose solution, and a food pellet). At the end of this training, the rat tends to press both levers, alternating between the sucrose solution and the food pellet. In a second phase, one of the reinforcers (e.g., the sucrose) is then separately paired with illness. This conditions a taste aversion to the sucrose. In a final test, the rat is returned to the Skinner box and allowed to press either lever freely. No reinforcers are presented during this test (i.e., no sucrose or food comes from pressing the levers), so behavior during testing can only result from the rat’s memory of what it has learned earlier. Importantly here, the rat chooses not to perform the response that once produced the reinforcer that it now has an aversion to (e.g., it won’t press the sucrose lever). This means that the rat has learned and remembered the reinforcer associated with each response, and can combine that knowledge with the knowledge that the reinforcer is now “bad.” Reinforcers do not merely stamp in responses; the animal learns much more than that. The behavior is said to be “goal-directed” (see Dickinson & Balleine, 1994), because it is influenced by the current value of its associated goal (i.e., how much the rat wants/doesn’t want the reinforcer).
5. habit: repetetive behaviour that can have bad effects. Things can get more complicated, however, if the rat performs the instrumental actions frequently and repeatedly. That is, if the rat has spent many months learning the value of pressing each of the levers, the act of pressing them becomes automatic and routine. And here, this once goal-directed action (i.e., the rat pressing the lever for the goal of getting sucrose/food) can become a habit. Thus, if a rat spends many months performing the lever-pressing behavior (turning such behavior into a habit), even when sucrose is again paired with illness, the rat will continue to press that lever (see Holland, 2004). After all the practice, the instrumental response (pressing the lever) is no longer sensitive to reinforcer devaluation. The rat continues to respond automatically, regardless of the fact that the sucrose from this lever makes it sick. 

## observational learning

By watching the behavior of the other kids, the child can figure out the rules of the game and even some strategies for doing well at the game. This is called observational learning. Four parts of observational learning
1. Attention
2. retention
3. initiation
4. motivation

vecarious reinforcement: A future adaptation of this study (Bandura, Ross, & Ross, 1963) demonstrated that children in the aggression group showed less aggressive behavior if they witnessed the adult model receive punishment for aggressing against Bobo. Bandura referred to this process as vicarious reinforcement, as the children did not experience the reinforcement or punishment directly, yet were still influenced by observing it
