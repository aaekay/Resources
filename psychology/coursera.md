# defence mechanisms
1. displacement: father hating child bullies kids
2. sublimation: forbidden sex desires seeking people devote extra time to work
3. projection: you disliking somebody and then you think that other person hates you
4. rationalisation: reasoning away anxiety producing thoughts, father beating child for child owns good
5. regression: regressing to earlier stage of development due to stress, can be seen in child
6. reaction formation: replacing threatening wishes to the opposite 

hysteria: when you cant contain the id, you devleop blindmess, paralysis, trembling, panic attacks, gap memory etc

catharsis: an explosive release of locked away memories

## inductive or deductive reasoning
inductive: drawing conclusions from a set of observations, eg science of meteorology
deductive: proof more associated, eg all living cells contain DNA

## level of analysis

# skinner
Presented the theory of behaviourism, articulated what was already there

main ideas of behaviourism
1. emphasis of learning - watson arguement of providing them the dozen healthy infants
2. anti - metalism == stick to things we can observe like observations, stimulus, responses rather than beliving on emotions, desires
3. no differences across species

# learning principles

## Habituation
## conditioning
### classical 
extinction
spontaneous recovery = response after some period of extinction
renewal effect =  After extinction, if the CS is tested in a new context, such as a different room or location, the CR can also return. In the chalkboard example, the action of entering a new building—where you don’t expect to smell chalkboards—suddenly renews the sensations associated with detention

### instrumental
learning what works and what doesnt
it is active
based on your own actions
the law of effect: the tendancy to perform an action reinforced if rewarded
reinforecements
    positive
    negative
shaping = activities which are approximated to action which is needed to reinforced

terms
1. stimulus control behaviour: , lever-pressing can be reinforced only when a light in the Skinner box is turned on; when the light is off, no food is released from lever-pressing
2. discriminative stimulus: The stimulus controlling the operant response is called a discriminative stimulus
3. quantitative law of effect: The law acknowledges the fact that the effects of reinforcing one behavior depend crucially on how much reinforcement is earned for the behavior’s alternatives. For example, if a pigeon learns that pecking one light will reward two food pellets, whereas the other light only rewards one, the pigeon will only peck the first light. However, what happens if the first light is more strenuous to reach than the second one? Will the cost of energy outweigh the bonus of food? Or will the extra food be worth the work?
4. reinforcer devaluation effect: A rat is first trained to perform two instrumental actions (e.g., pressing a lever on the left, and on the right), each paired with a different reinforcer (e.g., a sweet sucrose solution, and a food pellet). At the end of this training, the rat tends to press both levers, alternating between the sucrose solution and the food pellet. In a second phase, one of the reinforcers (e.g., the sucrose) is then separately paired with illness. This conditions a taste aversion to the sucrose. In a final test, the rat is returned to the Skinner box and allowed to press either lever freely. No reinforcers are presented during this test (i.e., no sucrose or food comes from pressing the levers), so behavior during testing can only result from the rat’s memory of what it has learned earlier. Importantly here, the rat chooses not to perform the response that once produced the reinforcer that it now has an aversion to (e.g., it won’t press the sucrose lever). This means that the rat has learned and remembered the reinforcer associated with each response, and can combine that knowledge with the knowledge that the reinforcer is now “bad.” Reinforcers do not merely stamp in responses; the animal learns much more than that. The behavior is said to be “goal-directed” (see Dickinson & Balleine, 1994), because it is influenced by the current value of its associated goal (i.e., how much the rat wants/doesn’t want the reinforcer).
5. habit: repetetive behaviour that can have bad effects. Things can get more complicated, however, if the rat performs the instrumental actions frequently and repeatedly. That is, if the rat has spent many months learning the value of pressing each of the levers, the act of pressing them becomes automatic and routine. And here, this once goal-directed action (i.e., the rat pressing the lever for the goal of getting sucrose/food) can become a habit. Thus, if a rat spends many months performing the lever-pressing behavior (turning such behavior into a habit), even when sucrose is again paired with illness, the rat will continue to press that lever (see Holland, 2004). After all the practice, the instrumental response (pressing the lever) is no longer sensitive to reinforcer devaluation. The rat continues to respond automatically, regardless of the fact that the sucrose from this lever makes it sick. 

## observational learning

By watching the behavior of the other kids, the child can figure out the rules of the game and even some strategies for doing well at the game. This is called observational learning. Four parts of observational learning
1. Attention
2. retention
3. initiation
4. motivation

vecarious reinforcement: A future adaptation of this study (Bandura, Ross, & Ross, 1963) demonstrated that children in the aggression group showed less aggressive behavior if they witnessed the adult model receive punishment for aggressing against Bobo. Bandura referred to this process as vicarious reinforcement, as the children did not experience the reinforcement or punishment directly, yet were still influenced by observing it

language: general system of conventional language here
"The girls thinks the house is big"
properties:

## language reading
1. priming: Priming occurs when your thinking about one concept (e.g., “ring”) reminds you about other related concepts (e.g., “marriage”, “wedding ceremony”). 
2. social brain hypothesis, Dunbar showed that those primate genera that have larger brains tend to live in larger groups. Furthermore, using the same equation, he was able to estimate the group size that human brains can support, which turned out to be about 150—approximately the size of modern hunter-gatherer communities. Dunbar’s argument is that language, brain, and human group living have co-evolved—language and human sociality are inseparable.
3. Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (Sapir, 1921; Whorf, 1956; Box 3). For instance, if you are given a description of a man, Steven, as having greater than average experience of the world (e.g., well-traveled, varied job experience), a strong family orientation, and well-developed social skills, how do you describe Steven? Do you think you can remember Steven’s personality five days later? It will probably be difficult. But if you know Chinese and are reading about Steven in Chinese, as Hoffman, Lau, and Johnson (1986) showed, the chances are that you can remember him well. This is because English does not have a word to describe this kind of personality, whereas Chinese does (shì gù). This way, the language you use can influence your cognition.

# Attention
Stroop effect: color labelled in different words of colors

# memory
1. encoding: selective, prolific- encoding the events of life, 
2. recoding: better recoding improve retention
    1. associate or correlated the meaning with already known information
    2. creating vivid images of them like imagination
    eg. he same thing happened with many other lists the authors used. This phenomenon is referred to as the DRM (for Deese-Roediger-McDermott) effect. One explanation for such results is that, while students listened to items in the list, the words triggered the students to think about window, even though window was never presented. In this way, people seem to encode events that are not actually part of their experience. 
    Participants hear lists of 15 words, like door, glass, pane, shade, ledge, sill, house, open, curtain, frame, view, breeze, sash, screen, and shutter. Later, participants are given a test in which they are shown a list of words and asked to pick out the ones they’d heard earlier. This second list contains some words from the first list (e.g., door, pane, frame) and some words not from the list (e.g., arm, phone, bottle). In this example, one of the words on the test is window, which—importantly—does not appear in the first list, but which is related to other words in that list. When subjects were tested, they were reasonably accurate with the studied words (door, etc.), recognizing them 72% of the time. However, when window was on the test, they falsely recognized it as having been on the list 84% of the time (Stadler, Roediger, & McDermott, 1999).

## remembring
1. retreival cues: like distinctiveness- something strange in a typical routine
2. compatibility principle: in the same context you learn them, both physiological and psychological context it is applicable, psyhological context means emotional, 
    *flashbulb memories* : his sort of vivid memory of finding out an important piece of new, our objective accuracy with them is far from perfect 
3. searching strategies: you keep on searching or explore things from different angels and you can see many thngs unfolding

## failures of memories
why do we forget things?
1. encoding failures
1. decay
2. interference: work with similar materials
    retroactive interference: Retroactive interference refers to new activities (i.e., the subsequent lunches) during the retention interval (i.e., the time between the lunch 17 days ago and now) that interfere with retrieving the specific, older memory (i.e., the lunch details from 17 days ago)
        misinformation effect
    Proactive interference is when past memories interfere with the encoding of new ones. For example, if you have ever studied a second language, often times the grammar and vocabulary of your native language will pop into your head, impairing your fluency in the foreign language
3. changes of retreival cues
4. forgetting through brain damages
5. trying not to remember

types of amnesia
1. retrograde amnesia
2. anterograde amnesia: not able to form new memories
    eg. clive wearing he's world-renowned choir director and musical arranger, and he suffered brain damage following viral encephalitis, which destroyed large areas of his brain, both temporal lobes, his entire hippocampus, and most of his left frontal lobes. He's lost a lot of memories of his past, but he also lost the ability to form new memories
     Clive's perception of his own condition is that because he has no memory whatsoever up to the currents 10, 20 seconds or maybe half a minute, depending on whether they've been distractive, any proactive interference and the whole, his conscious working span memory is that's current minute. Everything else behind the minute is blank. Everything until now is unknown and it's void. He uses the analogy of feeling as if he has just woken up. He says it's like just waking up for the first time. It's like just becoming conscious. It's as if I had been unconscious for however many years. Because for him, it is momentous, he has to write it down and he has to write it down in any available surface. If the diary is in front of him, he will write it down there. He will record the time, 10:50 a.m. awake first time, and then he looks we at the previous entry, which was 10:48 a.m. awake first time and he says, "No. I was awake then, that wasn't me. That wasn't proper awakeness. This is the first real awakeness. "

     they cant form new explicit memories but can form new implict memories ie skills, they can learn skills and get better with practice
3. organic vs functional or dissociative amnesia: organic is neurological while dissociative is mental

. This is because the neural structures involved in the enjoyment of rewards are different from the structures involved in the desire for the rewards.

*Panic attacks* appear to be an intense form of separation distress triggered by the attachment system, and panic can be effectively relieved by opiates. Testosterone also reduces separation distress, perhaps by reducing attachment needs. Consistent with this, panic attacks are more common in women than in men

natural selection causes organisms to spread the genes which is a misconception
1. ultimate causation: reason why something has evolved, includes creature history
2. proximate causation: what the organism want

## the psychology of groups
stereotypes: prejudice: discirmination
sterotypes are cognitive biases
prejudices are emotional biases
discrimination are behavioural biases

1. hazlitt says without prejudice, he wont be able to walk in the room
2. stereotypes are often positive and accurate

problems with stereotypes
1. not always accurate
2. first impreesion and hard to shake and make us bias
3. we naturally take group seriously even when the group is arbirary, like we tend to favour groups we like
4. we actively distinguish between groups leading to discrimination

social psychologists study stereotypes
this science is all about investigating the ways groups function, the costs and benefits of social status, the influences of culture, and all the other psychological processes involving two or more people.


type of stereotypes
1. public
2. private: harder to look at, looking at google searches, racial hatred, slower to change
3. implicit: unconscious association, without even relising it, implicit.harvard.edu
    creates a fraction of differences
    blind auditions tu curb hiring musicians
    using our heads to override our hearts
    
Prejudice, on the other hand, refers to how a person feels about an individual based on their group membership.

Blatant biases (also called “explicit biases”) are conscious beliefs, feelings, and behavior that people are perfectly willing to admit, which express hostility toward other groups (outgroups) while unduly favoring one’s own group (in-group). Classic examples of blatant bias include the views of members of hate groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and members of Hitler’s Nazi party.

Studies of ostracism—the deliberate exclusion from groups—indicate this experience is highly stressful and can lead to depression, confused thinking, and even aggression

*social felicitation* Triplett succeeded in sparking interest in a phenomenon now known as social facilitation: the enhancement of an individual’s performance when that person works in the presence of other people. If the task requires nondominant responses, i.e., novel, complicated, or untried behaviors that the organism has never performed before or has performed only infrequently, then the presence of others inhibits performance.
*evaluation apprehension*, particularly when we feel that our individual performance will be known to others, and those others might judge it negatively
The result is coordination loss: the three-person group is stronger than a single person, but not three times as strong. Second, people just don’t exert as much effort when working on a collective endeavor, nor do they expend as much cognitive effort trying to solve problems, as they do when working alone. They display social loafing.

Janis labeled this syndrome groupthink: “a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members’ strivings for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action

# Differences

## personality https://nobaproject.com/modules/personality-traits
cattell's 16 source of traits
The big five
1. neruoticism - stability
2. extron vs intro
3. open to non open
4. agreeable antagnoism
5. conscience - undirectedness

ocean  is mnemonic, Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism

 Their approach was guided by the lexical hypothesis, which states that all important personality characteristics should be reflected in the language that we use to describe other people

 The fact that there are different ways of being extraverted or conscientious shows that there is value in considering lower-level units of personality that are more specific than the Big Five traits. These more specific, lower-level units of personality are often called facets

 the HEXACO adds Honesty-Humility as a sixth dimension of personality

Two prominent examples of projective tests are the Rorschach Inkblot Test (Rorschach, 1921) and the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT).

## intelligence
1. The person best known for formally pioneering the measurement of intellectual ability is Alfred Binet. 
2. n the early 1900s the Binet-Simon test was adapted by a Stanford professor named Lewis Terman to create what is, perhaps, the most famous intelligence test in the world, the Stanford-Binet (Terman, 1916). The major advantage of this new test was that it was standardized. 
iq tests are not much valid.
3. Looking at another modern intelligence test—the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)—can provide clues to a definition of intelligence itself. Motivated by several criticisms of the Stanford-Binet test, psychologist David Wechsler sought to create a superior measure of intelligence

The flynn effect: When new waves of people are asked to take older tests they tend to outperform the original sample from years ago on which the test was normed.

#### male vs female
1. in a review of the research literature Halpern (1997) found that women appear, on average, superior to men on measures of fine motor skill, acquired knowledge, reading comprehension, decoding non-verbal expression, and generally have higher grades in school. Men, by contrast, appear, on average, superior to women on measures of fluid reasoning related to math and science, perceptual tasks that involve moving objects, and tasks that require transformations in working memory such as mental rotations of physical spaces.
2. One interesting phenomenon that has received research scrutiny is the idea of *stereotype threat*. Stereotype threat is the idea that mental access to a particular stereotype can have real-world impact on a member of the stereotyped group.
