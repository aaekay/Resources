# Statistics
### I just love statistics because it amazes me that how data is collected and we can do descriptive and inferential analysis with the help of it. It is just awesome. 
What could be the good sources to learn statistics?

Without hands on programming
1. *Explaining psychological statistics* by Cohen 
    Inferential statistics is really good, it is explaining null hypothesis in a practical manner.
