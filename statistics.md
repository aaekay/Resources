# Statistics
### I just love statistics because it amazes me that how data is collected and we can do descriptive and inferential analysis with the help of it. It is just awesome. 
What could be the good sources to learn statistics?

Are you the guy who just want to use statistics as a tool or need to know about how the things are derived?
