### Quotes

### writing style
The vivid description of scene, two different scenes being discussed line by line one after the another, was this creating any difference in the impact of stories. I dont know at this point but it sounds unique one scene of war describing vices of emotions intermingling with the discussion of naked love. Slowling two scenes dicussing three scenes and then discussing four and again three giving impression of simutaneoulsy happening events.
