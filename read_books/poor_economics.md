### Poor economics

#### exploring various ideas
idea of poverty trap
1. why does it occur?
    1. growing income or wealth at very fast rate is limited to those who have too little to invest but expands dramatically for those who can invest a bit more.
    2. there is no poverty trap where the potential for fast growth is high among poors and then tapers off as one gets richer.
2. visulising it

idea of poverty vs hunger
1. nutrition based poverty trap in an area where food is cheap and not resource affected
    1. food expenditures doesnt increase as the same proportion as income increases for the poor too.
        1. more income mean more expensive calorie
    2. people are eating less calorie per capita
        1. less hungry
            1. less diseases
            2. imporvent in water and sanitation - less physical work
            3. improvement in transportation
    3. role of calorie in productivity
        1. inverted L shaped curve bw calorie and productivity.
        2. so this might not be a poverty trap
2. physical health
    1. wasted children and Olympian failure—have something to do with each other.
        1. might be the reason for the lack of opportunities?
    2. good nourishment is equal to good height and smartness, height correlated with earning as height correlated with IQ
3. need for pleasant life
4. calorie based trap is rarley present, poor doesnt need cheap grains but good quality of food. My suggestion pertains to disease based poverty trap.

disease based poverty trap
1. low hanging fruits
    1. bleach, ORS
    2. immunisation, deworming drugs, exclusive breast feeding until six months
    3. tetanus shot, vit b, fe pills, fortified flour
2. highly effeective health investments
    1. against malaria
    2. access to clean water and sanitation.
3. why underutilisation
    1. expensive cure are always more famous than cheaper prevention. 
    2. psychological sunk cost effect: people are likely to make use of something that have paid a lot for. might not be a major effect. subsidies might not be the cause.
    3. faith, weak beliefs.
    4. Our natural inclination is to postpone small costs, so that they are borne not by our today self but by our tomorrow self instead.
    5. time inconsistency
4. solution (way of nudging people)
    1. deciding a default option and giving people right to choose what they want, but alternative option has small cost so more people end up choosing default
    2. small incentives another way to nudge people
    3. design nudges tailored to the environment of developing countries.

education based poverty trap
1. failure of schools in developing countries to attract children
    1. getting children to school vs the issue of learning.
    2. are schools actually making them learn or unlearn?
    3. expectations about what education is supposed to deliver distort what parents demand, what both public and private schools deliver, and what children achieve—and the colossal waste that ensues.
        1. parents expectations - acquiring considerable weatlh, govt job, education as a lottery ticket, S shaped curve of income vs education which doesnt exist.
    4. In reality no education-based poverty trap exist, Education is valuable at every level. But parents believe that the benefits of education are S—shaped leads them to behave as if there were a poverty trap, and thereby inadvertently to create one.
2. indirect investment
    1. parents invest, children get benefits. 
4. elitist school system
    1. colonial past, train a local elite to make effective allies of the colonial state and maximising distance from the locals.
    2. elit bias among teachers to prefer the elites.
    3. contrasting low expectations among children belonging to low socio economic status
    4. prejudiced and biased teachers towards chldren of low SES.
    5. stereotype threat.
5. solutions
    1. making a demand eg recruitment of jobs in a village, parents understand that they require
    2. the conditional cash transfer: PROGRESA of Santiago Levy. financial transfer if child goes to school.
    3. compulsory schooling
    4. quality of shcooling, public vs private.
    5. The problem is that there are no straightforward ways to identify talent, unless one is willing to spend a lot of time doing what the education system should have been doing: giving people enough chances to show what they are good at.
6. re engineering education
    1. focus on basic skills, commitment to the idea that every child can master them

Large families
1. enforced population control measures
    1. china one child policy
    2. sanjay gandhi advocating for sterilistaion during emergency
2. why people have large families?
    1. fertility decisions of people
        1. availability of contracetprives, itself do little
        2. rate of teenage pregnancies
            1. teenage seek older men, can start family, have income.
            2. lower educated mothers, less or no say in family practices.
        3. religion and society norms, usage among same community
        4. views about society and west, women empowerment
    2. children as financial instruments
        1. some will do well to take care in old age
        2. fewer children, more savings for themselves for some mishap

3. the gift of dying
    1. hiv-aids epidemic didnt lead to decline in fertility rate
4. poverty vs high fertility rate
    1. large family size appears to have had no adverse effects on the education of the children, counterintuitive







Priority of poors
1. tasty but less calorie food
2. making life less boring - basic pleasant life

#### Facts
1. On the occasion of the World Food Summit in 1996, the FAO estimated that world food production in that year was enough to provide at least 2,700 calories per person per day.10 This is the result of centuries of innovation in food supply, thanks no doubt to great innovations in agricultural science, but attributable also to more mundane factors such as the adoption of the potato into the diet after the Spanish discovered it in Peru in the sixteenth century and imported it to Europe.
2. As Amartya Sen has shown, however, most recent famines have been caused not by lack of food availability but by institutional failures that led to poor distribution of the available food, or even hoarding and storage in the face of starvation elsewhere
3.  Indian women, along with Nepalese and Bangladeshi women, are also among the shortest in the world.
4. Bangladesh, in particular, is the only country of over 100 million people that has never won an Olympic medal. The next largest such country is Nepal.
5. Understanding the importance of popular support, Antoine Parmentier, an eighteenth-century French pharmacist who was an early fan of the potato, clearly anticipating resistance, offered the public a set of recipes he had invented using potatoes, including the classic dish Hachis Parmentier (essentially what the British call shepherd’s pie, a layered casserole composed of ground meat with a covering of mashed potatoes). He thereby set off a trajectory that ultimately led, through many twists and turns, to the invention of “freedom fries.”
6. The SACC, rather more soberly, called for a regulation of the funeral industry, which, they felt, was putting pressure on families to spend more than they could afford.
7. Every village in India has at least one small shop, usually more, with shampoo sold in individual sachets, cigarettes by the stick, very cheap combs, pens, toys, or candies, whereas in a country like Papua New Guinea, where the share of food in the household budget is above 70 percent (it is 50 percent in India), there may be fewer things available to the poor.
8. In the local parlance, unqualified doctors like these are referred to as “Bengali doctors,” because one of the earliest medical colleges in India was in Bengal and doctors from Bengal fanned across northern India looking for places to practice medicine. That tradition has continued—people continue to show up in a village with little more than a stethoscope and a bag of standard medications and set up as Bengali doctors, irrespective of whether they are from Bengal or not.
9. One of the Bengali doctors we spoke to explained the role he plays in the lives of the poor as follows: “The poor cannot really afford to get treated for anything major, because that involves expensive things like tests and hospitalization, which is why they come to me with their minor ailments, and I give them some little medicines which make them feel better.”
10. We should recognize that no one is wise, patient, or knowledgeable enough to be fully responsible for making the right decisions for his or her own health.
11. Under the banner of the Annual State of Education Report (ASER), Pratham formed volunteer teams in all 600 Indian districts. These teams tested more than 1,000 children in randomly chosen villages in every district—700,000 children overall—and came up with a report card. One of the leading lights of the ruling Congress-led government, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, launched the report, but what he read could not have made him happy. Close to 35 percent of children in the seven-to-fourteen age group could not read a simple paragraph (first-grade level) and almost 60 percent of children could not read a simple story (second-grade level). Only 30 percent could do second-grade mathematics (basic division).6 The math results are particularly stunning—all over the Third World, little boys and girls who help their parents in their family stall or store do much more complicated calculations all the time, without the help of pen and paper. Are schools actually making them unlearn?
12. The willingness to use words like “stupid” and “intelligent” to refer to one’s own children, often in their presence, is entirely consistent with a worldview that puts a large premium on picking a winner (and in getting everyone else in the family to back the winner). This belief creates a strange form of sibling rivalry. In Burkina Faso, a study found that adolescents were more likely to be enrolled in school when they scored high on a test of intelligence, but they were less likely to be enrolled in school when their siblings had scored high.
13. The lower-caste teachers were actually more likely to assign worse grades to lower-caste students. They must have been convinced these children could not do well.
14. Indeed, for most of human history (starting in 1 million BC), regions or countries that had more people were growing faster than the rest.
15. A striking feature of HIV is that women from the ages of fifteen to nineteen are five times more likely to be infected than young men in the same cohort. 

#### Quotes
1. It is possible to make the world a better place—probably not tomorrow, but in some future that is within our reach—but we cannot get there with lazy thinking.
2. When you are unemployed, you don’t want to eat dull wholesome food. You want to eat something a little tasty. There is always some cheap pleasant thing to tempt you.
3. But they don’t necessarily reduce their standards by cutting out luxuries and concentrating on necessities; more often it is the other way around—the more natural way, if you come to think of it—hence the fact that in a decade of unparalleled depression, the consumption of all cheap luxuries has increased.
4. Our natural inclination is to postpone small costs, so that they are borne not by our today self but by our tomorrow self instead.

#### thought
1. the privileged never have to think about the food source, safe water and sewage which gives them time to think about something else like science, innovation etc but sometimes the people who are in desperate need of something find ways to get it and make it easy for the others like him to get it simultaneously.
2. how the depression, anxiety, competition and distractions like social media or existential crisis is affecting the children already getting education. 
3. sometimes it seems that the world has no hope but after reading this book small changes can lead to big appreciable effect after a period of patience.
4. making an organisation and teaching students about basic necessities of life, like safe food, water, finance, utility, bills, how market works, entrepreneuships, applying for sops, express interests.
