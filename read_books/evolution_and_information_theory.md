1. In  his  book,  Descent  of  Man  (John  Murray,  London,   1871)  CharlesDarwin  wrote:   "Man  has  an  instinctive  tendency  to  speak,  as  we  see  inthe  babble  of young children,  while no  child  has an  instinctive  tendency  tobake,  brew  or write."  Thus  Darwin  was aware  of the  genetic  component  oflearning  of  speech  by babies.


Facts
1. In  fact,  it  was what  we now  call  "India  ink".  However,  in  spite  ofits  name, India  ink  is a  Chinese invention,  which later  spread  to  India  andfrom  there to  Europe.
2. The failure  to  develop a phonetic  system  of writing  had  its  roots in theChinese imperial  system  of government.  The  Chinese empire formed  a vastarea  in  which  many  different  languages  were  spoken.  It  was  necessary  tohave a universal  language  of  some kind  in  order to  govern  such  an empire.The  Chinese written  language  solved this  problem  admirably.Suppose  that  the  emperor  sent  identical  letters  to  two  officials  in  dif-ferent  districts.  Reading  the  letters  aloud,  the  officials  might  use  entirelydifferent  words, although the  characters in the letters  were the  same.  Thusthe  Chinese written language was a sort  of  "Esperanto"  which allowed com-munication  between  various  language  groups,  and  its  usefulness  as  suchprevented  its  replacement  by  a phonetic  system.
3. Hermann  Hol-lerith, a statistician  working for the United States Bureau  of the Census.  Heinvented  electromechanical  machines  for  reading and  sorting data  punchedonto  cards.  Hollerith's  machines  were  used  to  analyze  the  data  from  the1890 United  States  Census.  Because the  Census Bureau  was a very limitedmarket, Hollerith branched out  and began to manufacture  similar  machinesfor  use  in  business  and  administration.  His  company  was later  bought  outby  Thomas  J.  Watson,  who  changed  its  name  to  International  BusinessMachines.

### Science
1. simple machinery of photosynthesis or trapping photon into chemical energy - bacteriorhodopsin
2. genetic algorithms are subject of intensive research look after it
3.  Langton introduced  a parameter Ato characterize various sets  of rules according to the type  of behavior whichthey  generated.   Rule  sets  with  a  value  near  to  the  optimum  (A =  0.273)generated complexity similar to that  found  in biological systems.  This valueof Langton's  A  parameter  corresponded  to  a borderline  region  between pe-riodicity  and  chaos.
4. ray experiment of computer viruses
