# Resources
Compiled list of resources in the field of neuroscience, machine learning or artifical intelligence. This is not any other resource list where bunch of links are provided, they are personal used resources like for a certain topic some link and for some other a whole book.

I am dividing this topic in three fields
1. Neuroscience [link](/neuroscience.md)
2. Machine learning [link](/machine_learning.md)
3. computer science resources[link](/cs.md)
4. Statistics [link](/statistics.md)
4. ebooks [link](/ebooks.md)
5. Life hacks [link](/lifehacks.md)


Note: if you are curious what is git or why should we use git so here is another [link](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/01-basics/index.html). It is not beginner friendly though.
